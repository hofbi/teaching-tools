# Homework Example

This slide won't be considered for parsing

---

## Task 1 - Example

The title of this slide will be used as the issue title.
Creating a new slide will result in a new issue.

The text here will be used as description for the issue.
Since the issues support markdown, all markdown features can be used here.
The text might exceed the slide using the Marp viewer
But we use the slide separators only for separating a new issue and they were not considered to be inspected as slides.

Whatever is under the documentation listed below will be put on every issue of that homework.

Additionally, we can automatically assign labels based on the homework number provided via the CLI and provide due dates.
Find all options in the `README.md` of the tools.

Lastly, we support attachments to the issues.
They can used via local links relative to the repo root, e.g. the [README.md](/tools/README.md) of the tools.
